Hi, and welcome to my personal website! This site gives a snapshot of who I am, the projects I've built, and the work I'm most proud of. I designed and built this site in the weeks after graduating from the University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Science with a B.S. in Computer Science. It reflects my passion for combining technical skill with clean design and clear communication—and will continue to evolve as I do!

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**, **CSS3** for layout and styling  
- **JavaScript** for functionality and interactivity  
- **Swiper.js** for sleek, mobile-friendly project sliders
